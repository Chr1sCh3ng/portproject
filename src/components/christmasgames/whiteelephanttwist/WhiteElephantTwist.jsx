        Set the rules: Add a personal note that participants should bring gifts
        that are useful or desirable, rather than gag or funny gifts. Encourage
        re-gifting something useful or getting something useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask participants to bring wrapped gifts: Each participant should bring a
        wrapped gift to the gathering. The gift should be anonymous, without any
        identifying information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrange a gift display: Set up a designated area where the gifts will be
        placed. This can be a table or a specific location in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determine the order of play: You can randomly assign a playing order or
        use a method like drawing numbers from a hat. The first person will
        select a gift from the display.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unwrapping or stealing: The first player may choose to open their gift
        immediately after selecting it from the display. The following players
        can either choose an unopened gift from the display or steal a gift that
        has already been opened.
      </p>
      <p>
        A gift can only be stolen twice. After it has been stolen twice, it
        becomes locked or frozen and cannot be stolen anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue the game: Proceed with the turns, allowing each subsequent
        player to either select an unopened gift from the display or steal from
        another participant. Players may choose to open their gift immediately
        upon selecting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Final player's turn: After all the players have had their turns, the
        first player gets the opportunity to either keep their gift or steal
        from any of the previously opened gifts. This final steal concludes the
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        White Elephant is known for its element of surprise and the fun
        interactions that arise when participants strategize and make decisions
        about stealing gifts. Just remember to establish clear rules at the
        beginning, encourage useful gifts, and ensure that everyone has a chance
        to participate and enjoy the game.
